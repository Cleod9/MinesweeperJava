# Java MineSweeper #

This is a simple MineSweeper program written by me in high school. Although the artwork leaves a lot to be desired, this is essentially the same as the Windows version, so it's pretty self explanatory. The game is executed within `MineSweeperRunner.java`, so make sure to compile the other classes first before compiling and running `MineSweeperRunner.java`

### Minimum required classes for using this application: ###

- Grid.class
- wQuit.class (already within Grid.java)


## Terms of Use ##

Free to use in any projects without notifying me, nor is credit needed (though it'd be much appreciated!). Just do not re-distribute it under anyone else's name and be sure to retain the copyright notice in the source!
